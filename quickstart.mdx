   >3 Bias towards another member is prohibited

   >4 Do not use your own personal emotions or feelings as a reason to moderate

   >5 Do not misuse your power
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="pen-ruler" title="Rules / Enhanced">
  To avoid certain workarounds to some of the above rules here is an indepth example of each of the standard rules but explained more indepth incase its not clear enough and you need some clarification.

  > **Rule 1 - No instigating drama amongst members**

  What this means is, if you see members in chat fighting and arguing don't pick a side and make the drama 10x worse, you are a member of the team that is supposed to prevent said drama not join in on it.

  But you also have a right to defend your honour but keep it to a minimum and say what only needs to be said and do it in a correct mature manner. 

  > **Rule 2 - Be firm and direct**

  What this means is, if you need to act in a situation whether its a formal warning or a mute or whatnot, be FIRM don't be soft, get your point across and don't sugarcoat it, they need to know what they did was wrong not be babied

  > **Rule 3 - Bias towards another member is prohibited**

  This is quite straight forward, punish everyone the same including your besties in the server, It doesn't matter that you are their #1 they are not immune to the rules for being friends of staff

  > **Rule 4 - Do not use your own personal emotions or feelings as a reason to moderate** 

  What this means is, if its not violating a rule but is upsetting you that is not grounds for a punishment, just because your feelings are hurt doesn't make it okay to mute, warn, jail, etc someone as that would be an abuse of power, take a breather and recount your thoughts and move on.

  > **Rule 5 - Do not misuse your power**

  This basically is all the rules in one, don't use any of your staff powers for non punishable reasons, dont be warning your friends for stupid reasons and whatever.

  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.

  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
